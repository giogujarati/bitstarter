This is the master branch of project "Car and Shopper". The project is being developed as part of 
the Startup Engineering class of summer 2013 on coursera. Car and Shopper is responsive-web design
application that makes car buying easy by allowing a user to choose a make. model and year (and
other configurations) and then state the price he/she is willing to pay for it. A seller then
either matches the price or proposes an alternative (either for price or configuration).

Car and shopper takes a small percentage from the seller. Advertisement is also a planned
source of revenue.
